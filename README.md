# LeetCode Problems

LeetCode is a website targeted towards software engineers and programmers to keep their skills sharp and prepare for technical interviews. Questions can involve general code problems, algorithms, databases, etc.

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and to keep a note of potentially useful algorithms.

Each solved problem is placed into three folders depending on the difficulty: Easy, Medium or Hard.

I am currently solely using Python3 to solve problems.
